<H2>Welcome to the EverQuest guild called <B>The Healers' Love.</B></H2>
<H4>NEWS:</H4>
<p>---Well, as you can tell, I just started this page (as with this guild), and there is not much here....I also just started HTML so what you see may seem small, but took me FOREVER to make!  The hard part is over, and should get some good looking udates soon.  When a new page comes up, don't be to dissapointed, for it will get better! =)
<P>---If you wait long enough, a dragon head should appear...I must find out how to make it come up faster...any comments?
<P>---Well, the only links not working is the History and Forum...and I seem to have a problem with where the frames pop up, well, you see....
<P>---I am looking for a counter now, if you know where I can get a good one, mabey one with fantasy elemets, give me a drop at <U><A HREF="mailto:maxwell87@worldnet.att.net">maxwell87@worldnet.att.net</A></U>.
