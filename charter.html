<H1>Charter:</H1>
<P>	Through the many years of life the healers of Norrath have taken watch of the evils and fowl undead monsters that seek to destroy and corrupt.  By becomeing of Clerics, Paladins, and other healing classes we look for groups in anyway we can, all alone trying to find people in need of our services.  Finnally, we can unit to ONE force to help in aiding the good people of Norrath and strive to bandage the wounds ripped into the land and continue our ever going quest to help put life into the earth where the decay of Innoruuk and his vile followers have been.
