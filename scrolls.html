<LI>All members of any rank must have a kind heart and some healing and buffing power, but if you can't heal, than you will become a "Follower", but you still have to have a good heart.
<LI>If you are evil the guild Officers will and I will have a talk to see if you can come in, better have a good faction, and if let in, we will try to help your faction.
